These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

  abstract = {Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art.},

  shorttitle = {Best of {{Both Worlds}}},
  abstract = {Wayne Clough, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, asks museums a fundamental question: "How can we prepare ourselves to reach the generation of digital natives who bring a huge appetite-and aptitude-for the digital world?" His thoughts on how the Smithsonian is tackling this issue and how others have fared in museums and libraries around the world are the subject of a new e-book, Best of Both Worlds: Museums, Libraries, and Archives in a Digital Age.The e-book begins with a summary of what has already taken place in libraries and archives-documents once available only in the stacks or back rooms are now available, often for free, through the Internet. The Library of Congress and the National Archives, along with thousands of local libraries around the country, have led the way in digitizing two-dimensional objects.For museums, the digital world presents a bigger challenge. Clough cites several reasons for this. First, and most obvious: Producing images of three-dimensional objects is more complicated than taking a picture of a page and adding some data. Most museums, including the Smithsonian, previously have not had high levels of technical expertise and equipment. Adding to the challenge is the simple fact that collections are built with exhibitions in mind rather than open access on computers.With 137 million objects in its care, how did the Smithsonian begin the process of digitizing its vast collections to make them accessible to the millions of people who do not visit the museums in person? Clough describes the journey that began in 2009 with setting priorities for what would be digitized-a total of 14 million objects."The physical museum offers visitors the opportunity to experience the real object and share their impressions with family and friends," Clough said. "Digital access can then provide limitless opportunities for engagement and lifelong learning."Museums do not give degrees but they do provide informal education through their research, scholarship and exhibitions, both real and virtual. Clough sees museums gradually moving beyond showcasing collections to engaging the public online where the "visitors" can sort out and access the objects they find most interesting and then interact directly with the museums.Education has always been at the core of the Smithsonian. Today, the Smithsonian offers materials and lesson plans that meet state standards for K-12 curricula; online national summits for teens on subjects such as the 1961 Freedom Riders, the environment and the 1930s Dust Bowl; the Collections Search Center website; and apps such as Leafsnap that allow people to take a picture of a tree's leaf and have it identified in seconds. One of the most visible examples of informal education is the Smithsonian's website, www.seriouslyamazing.com, which draws people in with fun questions and, with another click, takes them deeper into the subject. For example, when the question "What European colonizer is still invading the U.S. today?" is clicked on, the answer, earthworms, appears along with further in-depth information on worms from environmental researchers.Museums have moved slowly-frequently project by project-into the brave new digital world, according to Clough. There are many good reasons for this cautious path, but "the time for toe-dipping is ending for museums, since they cannot stand aloof from the rising tide of information convergence."Clough concludes his 75-page online book with this thought: "While digital technology poses great challenges, it also offers great possibilities. For the Smithsonian and our nation's other museums, libraries and archives, today is a time when we can serve the role our founders envisioned for the educational systems of our republic. We can help all the people,},

  abstract = {Recent results indicate that the generic descriptors extracted from the convolutional neural networks are very powerful. This paper adds to the mounting evidence that this is indeed the case. We report on a series of experiments conducted for different recognition tasks using the publicly available code and model of the $\backslash$overfeat network which was trained to perform object classification on ILSVRC13. We use features extracted from the $\backslash$overfeat network as a generic image representation to tackle the diverse range of recognition tasks of object image classification, scene recognition, fine grained recognition, attribute detection and image retrieval applied to a diverse set of datasets. We selected these tasks and datasets as they gradually move further away from the original task and data the $\backslash$overfeat network was trained to solve. Astonishingly, we report consistent superior results compared to the highly tuned state-of-the-art systems in all the visual classification tasks on various datasets. For instance retrieval it consistently outperforms low memory footprint methods except for sculptures dataset. The results are achieved using a linear SVM classifier (or \$L2\$ distance in case of retrieval) applied to a feature representation of size 4096 extracted from a layer in the net. The representations are further modified using simple augmentation techniques e.g. jittering. The results strongly suggest that features obtained from deep learning with convolutional nets should be the primary candidate in most visual recognition tasks.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

In object and scene analysis, deep neural nets are capable of learning a hierarchical chain of abstraction from pixel inputs to concise and descriptive representations. The current work explores this capacity in the realm of document analysis, and confirms that this representation strategy is superior to a variety of popular hand-crafted alternatives. Experiments also show that (i) features extracted from CNNs are robust to compression, (ii) CNNs trained on non-document images transfer well to document analysis tasks, and (iii) enforcing region-specific feature-learning is unnecessary given sufficient training data. This work also makes available a new labelled subset of the IIT-CDIP collection, containing 400,000 document images across 16 categories, useful for training new CNNs for document analysis.},

  abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

We call our algorithm convolutional k-means clustering. We further show that learning the connection between the layers of a deep convolutional neural network improves its ability to be trained on a smaller amount of labeled data. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other techniques that learn filters unsupervised. Specifically, we obtained a test accuracy of 74.1\% on STL-10 and a test error of 0.5\% on MNIST.},

  abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30\% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012---achieving a mAP of 53.3\%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset.

In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skip-gram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram, words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpus quickly.

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

  abstract = {Image-based sequence recognition has been a long-standing research topic in computer vision. In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text recognition, which is among the most important and challenging tasks in image-based sequence recognition. A novel neural network architecture, which integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling and transcription into a unified framework, is proposed. Compared with previous systems for scene text recognition, the proposed architecture possesses four distinctive properties: (1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms whose components are separately trained and tuned. (2) It naturally handles sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet much smaller model, which is more practical for real-world application scenarios. The experiments on standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text and ICDAR datasets, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the prior arts. Moreover, the proposed algorithm performs well in the task of image-based music score recognition, which evidently verifies the generality of it.},

Our framework does not require any human-labelled data, and performs word recognition on the whole image holistically, departing from the character based recognition systems of the past. The deep neural network models at the centre of this framework are trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation engine -- synthetic data that is highly realistic and sufficient to replace real data, giving us infinite amounts of training data. This excess of data exposes new possibilities for word recognition models, and here we consider three models, each one "reading" words in a different way: via 90k-way dictionary encoding, character sequence encoding, and bag-of-N-grams encoding. In the scenarios of language based and completely unconstrained text recognition we greatly improve upon state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets, using our fast, simple machinery and requiring zero data-acquisition costs.},

  abstract = {Relational reasoning is a central component of generally intelligent behavior, but has proven difficult for neural networks to learn. In this paper we describe how to use Relation Networks (RNs) as a simple plug-and-play module to solve problems that fundamentally hinge on relational reasoning. We tested RN-augmented networks on three tasks: visual question answering using a challenging dataset called CLEVR, on which we achieve state-of-the-art, super-human performance; text-based question answering using the bAbI suite of tasks; and complex reasoning about dynamic physical systems. Then, using a curated dataset called Sort-of-CLEVR we show that powerful convolutional networks do not have a general capacity to solve relational questions, but can gain this capacity when augmented with RNs. Our work shows how a deep learning architecture equipped with an RN module can implicitly discover and learn to reason about entities and their relations.},

Given only a large, unlabeled image collection, we extract random pairs of patches from each image and train a convolutional neural net to predict the position of the second patch relative to the first. We argue that doing well on this task requires the model to learn to recognize objects and their parts. We demonstrate that the feature representation learned using this within-image context indeed captures visual similarity across images. For example, this representation allows us to perform unsupervised visual discovery of objects like cats, people, and even birds from the Pascal VOC 2011 detection dataset. Furthermore, we show that the learned ConvNet can be used in the R-CNN framework and provides a significant boost over a randomly-initialized ConvNet, resulting in state-of-the-art performance among algorithms which use only Pascal-provided training set annotations.},

  abstract = {The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with high capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of large-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10x or 100x? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.},

  abstract = {Document Analysis and Recognition (DAR) has two main objectives, first the analysis of the physical structure of the input image of the document, which should lead to the correct identification of the corresponding different homogeneous components and their boundaries in terms of XY coordinates. Second, each of these homogeneous components should be recognized in such a way that, if it is a text image, consequently this image should be recognized and translated into an intelligible text. DAR remains one of the most challenging topics in pattern recognition. Indeed, despite the diversity of the proposed approaches, techniques and methods, results remain very weak and away from expectations especially for several categories of documents such as complex, low quality, handwritten and historical documents. The complex structure and/or morphology of such documents are behind the weakness of results of these proposed approaches, techniques and methods. One of the challenging problems related to this topic is the creation of standard datasets that can be used by all stakeholders of this topic such as system developers, expert evaluators, and users. In addition, another challenging problem is how one could take advantages of all existing datasets that unfortunately are dispersed around the world without knowing, most of the times, any information about their locations and the way to reach them. As an attempt to solve the two mentioned above problems, we propose in this paper a Universal Datasets Repository for Document Analysis and Recognition (UMDAR) that has, in fact, a twofold advantage. First, it can help dataset creators to standardize their datasets and making them accessible to the research community once published on the proposed repository. Second, it can be used as a central which bridges in a smart manner between datasets and all DAR stakeholders.},

Producing groundtruth by these means is laborious and not needed to determine a method's quality. In this paper we propose a new evaluation scheme that is based on baselines.

  shorttitle = {Batch {{Normalization}}},
  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  abstract = {In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed "DeepLab" system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7\% mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes. All of our code is made publicly available online.},

  abstract = {Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

Many existing methods either rely on hand-crafted features or perform rather slow as they treat the problem as a pixel-level assignment problem. In order to create a feasible method for real applications, we propose to use superpixels as basic units of segmentation, and features are learned directly from pixels. An image is first oversegmented into superpixels with the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm. Then, each superpixel is represented by the features of its central pixel. The features are learned from pixel intensity values with stacked convolutional autoencoders in an unsupervised manner. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify superpixels into four classes: periphery, background, text block, and decoration. Finally, the segmentation results are refined by a connected component based smoothing procedure. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that compared to our previous method, the proposed method is much faster and achieves comparable segmentation results. Additionally, much fewer pixels are used for classifier training.},

Typically, the weights of a deep neural network are initialized with: random values, greedy layer-wise pre-training (usually as Deep Belief Network or as auto-encoder) or by re-using the layers from another network (transfer learning). Hence, many training epochs are needed before meaningful weights are learned, or a rather similar dataset is required for seeding a fine-tuning of transfer learning. In this paper, we describe how to turn an LDA into either a neural layer or a classification layer. We analyze the initialization technique on historical documents. First, we show that an LDA-based initialization is quick and leads to a very stable initialization. Furthermore, for the task of layout analysis at pixel level, we investigate the effectiveness of LDA-based initialization and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art random weight initialization methods.},

Our method uses various features of diverse nature taking the surrounding window into account. The influence of the features and their parameters are investigated and optimized on a validation set. Each foreground pixel is then classified by a multilayer perceptron using feature vectors based on a pixel neighborhood. Finally, a post-processing step corrects typical misclassifications, i.e., It removes outliers based on several heuristics. We evaluated our method on printed documents with real handwritten annotations and reached an accuracy of 96.10\% on the test set.

Finally, the segmentation results are refined by a smoothing post-processing procedure. The proposed method is demonstrated by experiments conducted on three different historical handwritten document image datasets. Experiments show the benefit of combining various color and texture features for classification.

Unconstrained polygons are used to outline the regions. A performance metric is proposed in order to evaluate various page segmentation methods based on this model. We have analysed four state-of-the-art ground-truthing tools: TRUVIZ, GEDI, WebGT, and Aletheia. From this analysis, we conceptualized and developed Divadia, a new tool that overcomes some of the drawbacks of these tools, targeting the simplicity and the efficiency of the layout ground truthing process on historical document images. With Divadia, we have created a new public dataset. This dataset contains 120 pages from three historical document image collections of different styles and is made freely available to the scientific community for historical document layout analysis research.},

First, we regress pixels into a hyper-spherical embedding space so that pixels from the same group have high cosine similarity while those from different groups have similarity below a specified margin. We analyze the choice of embedding dimension and margin, relating them to theoretical results on the problem of distributing points uniformly on the sphere. Second, to group instances, we utilize a variant of mean-shift clustering, implemented as a recurrent neural network parameterized by kernel bandwidth. This recurrent grouping module is differentiable, enjoys convergent dynamics and probabilistic interpretability. Backpropagating the group-weighted loss through this module allows learning to focus on only correcting embedding errors that won't be resolved during subsequent clustering. Our framework, while conceptually simple and theoretically abundant, is also practically effective and computationally efficient. We demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art instance segmentation for object proposal generation, as well as demonstrating the benefits of grouping loss for classification tasks such as boundary detection and semantic segmentation.},

We evaluate all methods on ImageNet classification, PASCAL VOC detection, and NYU depth prediction. Our results show that deeper networks work better, and that combining tasks--even via a naive multi-head architecture--always improves performance.

  abstract = {The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has demonstrated the unique advantage in audio, image and text learning; recently it has also challenged Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory cells (LSTM) in sequence-to-sequence learning, since the computations involved in CNN are easily parallelizable whereas those involved in RNN are mostly sequential, leading to a performance bottleneck. However, unlike RNN, the native CNN lacks the history sensitivity required for sequence transformation; therefore enhancing the sequential order awareness, or position-sensitivity, becomes the key to make CNN the general deep learning model. In this work we introduce an extended CNN model with strengthen position-sensitivity, called PoseNet. A notable feature of PoseNet is the asymmetric treatment of position information in the encoder and the decoder. Experiments shows that PoseNet allows us to improve the accuracy of CNN based sequence-to-sequence learning significantly, achieving around 33-36 BLEU scores on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, and around 44-46 BLEU scores on the English-to-French translation task.},

  abstract = {Deep learning thrives with large neural networks and large datasets. However, larger networks and larger datasets result in longer training times that impede research and development progress. Distributed synchronous SGD offers a potential solution to this problem by dividing SGD minibatches over a pool of parallel workers. Yet to make this scheme efficient, the per-worker workload must be large, which implies nontrivial growth in the SGD minibatch size. In this paper, we empirically show that on the ImageNet dataset large minibatches cause optimization difficulties, but when these are addressed the trained networks exhibit good generalization. Specifically, we show no loss of accuracy when training with large minibatch sizes up to 8192 images. To achieve this result, we adopt a linear scaling rule for adjusting learning rates as a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup scheme that overcomes optimization challenges early in training. With these simple techniques, our Caffe2-based system trains ResNet-50 with a minibatch size of 8192 on 256 GPUs in one hour, while matching small minibatch accuracy. Using commodity hardware, our implementation achieves \textasciitilde{}90\% scaling efficiency when moving from 8 to 256 GPUs. This system enables us to train visual recognition models on internet-scale data with high efficiency.},

Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners.

  abstract = {We investigate omni-supervised learning, a special regime of semi-supervised learning in which the learner exploits all available labeled data plus internet-scale sources of unlabeled data. Omni-supervised learning is lower-bounded by performance on existing labeled datasets, offering the potential to surpass state-of-the-art fully supervised methods. To exploit the omni-supervised setting, we propose data distillation, a method that ensembles predictions from multiple transformations of unlabeled data, using a single model, to automatically generate new training annotations. We argue that visual recognition models have recently become accurate enough that it is now possible to apply classic ideas about self-training to challenging real-world data. Our experimental results show that in the cases of human keypoint detection and general object detection, state-of-the-art models trained with data distillation surpass the performance of using labeled data from the COCO dataset alone.},

By following the principles of self-supervision, we build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can be trained to solve Jigsaw puzzles as a pretext task, which requires no manual labeling, and then later repurposed to solve object classification and detection. To maintain the compatibility across tasks we introduce the context-free network (CFN), a siamese-ennead CNN. The CFN takes image tiles as input and explicitly limits the receptive field (or context) of its early processing units to one tile at a time. We show that the CFN includes fewer parameters than AlexNet while preserving the same semantic learning capabilities. By training the CFN to solve Jigsaw puzzles, we learn both a feature mapping of object parts as well as their correct spatial arrangement. Our experimental evaluations show that the learned features capture semantically relevant content. Our proposed method for learning visual representations outperforms state of the art methods in several transfer learning benchmarks.},

  abstract = {We propose a high-performance fully convolutional neural network (FCN) for historical handwritten document segmentation that is designed to process a single page in one step. The advantage of this model beside its speed is its ability to directly learn from raw pixels instead of using preprocessing steps e. g. feature computation or superpixel generation. We show that this network yields better results than existing methods on different public data sets. For evaluation of this model we introduce a novel metric that is independent of ambiguous ground truth called Foreground Pixel Accuracy (FgPA). This pixel based measure only counts foreground pixels in the binarized page, any background pixel is omitted. The major advantage of this metric is, that it enables researchers to compare different segmentation methods on their ability to successfully segment text or pictures and not on their ability to learn and possibly overfit the peculiarities of an ambiguous hand-made ground truth segmentation.},

We propose a comprehensive experimental study that compares three types of visual document image representations: (1) traditional so-called shallow features, such as the RunLength and the Fisher-Vector descriptors, (2) deep features based on Convolutional Neural Networks, and (3) features extracted from hybrid architectures that take inspiration from the two previous ones. We evaluate these features in several tasks (i.e. classification, clustering, and retrieval) and in different setups (e.g. domain transfer) using several public and in-house datasets. Our results show that deep features generally outperform other types of features when there is no domain shift and the new task is closely related to the one used to train the model. However, when a large domain or task shift is present, the Fisher-Vector shallow features generalize better and often obtain the best results.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently.

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

In this work, we propose a pixel-wise segmentation method for historical handwritten documents using fully convolutional network (FCN). The document image is segmented into different regions by classifying pixels into different categories: background, main text body, comments, and decorations. By supervised learning on document images with pixel-wise labels, the FCN can extract discriminative features and perform pixel-wise segmentation accurately. After pixel-wise classification, post-processing steps are taken to reduce noises, correct wrong segmentations and find out overlapping regions. Experimental results on the public dataset DIVA-HisDB containing challenging medieval manuscripts demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, which yields pixel-level accuracy of above 99\%.},

In this competition we introduce a new challenging dataset and state-of-the-art benchmark results for pixel-labelling and text line segmentation. The DIVA-HisDB comprises medieval manuscripts with complex layout in contrast to previous datasets, where rectangular text blocks and only a few decorative elements exist. In particular, the images of this competition contain many interlinear and marginal glosses as well as texts in various sizes and decorated letters. This makes the distinction of the four target labels (text, comment, decoration, and background) more difficult. In addition, to reflect the needs of scholars in the humanities, we request multi-labeling of certain regions (decorated text as text and decoration). Furthermore, we measure not just the accuracy, but the Intersection over Union (IU) of pixel sets, which better reflects the real performance. Indeed, in our results we observe that the accuracy appears to be rather high, but the IU reveals, that there is still room for improvement. For the task of line segmentation, the recognition results are rather low (overall error higher than 5\%). Noteworthy, a combination of the best layout analysis method with an adapted seam-carving based method achieves better results than the best contestant.},

  abstract = {Als Keilschrift bezeichnet man ein vom 34. Jahrhundert v. Chr. bis mindestens ins 1. Jahrhundert n. Chr. benutztes Schriftsystem, das im Vorderen Orient zum Schreiben mehrerer Sprachen verwendet wurde. Die Bezeichnung beruht auf den Grundelementen der Keilschrift: waagrechten, senkrechten und schrägen Keilen. Typische Textträger sind Tontafeln, die durch das Eindrücken eines Schreibgriffels in den noch weichen Ton beschrieben wurden.
Die Keilschrift war anfänglich eine Bilderschrift. Sie entwickelte sich zu einer Silbenschrift, aus der auch eine phonetische Konsonantenschrift (die ugaritische Schrift) hervorging. Die Keilschrift wurde von den Sumerern erfunden und später von zahlreichen Völkern des Alten Orients verwendet: von den Akkadern, Babyloniern, Assyrern, Hethitern, Persern und anderen. Schließlich wurde sie von anderen Schriftformen (z. B. der phönizischen Schrift) verdrängt und geriet in Vergessenheit. Letzte Keilschrifttexte wurden in seleukidischer Zeit verfasst.},
